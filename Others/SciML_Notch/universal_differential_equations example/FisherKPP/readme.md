# Model-based learning of the Fisher-KPP equation

The following scripts generate data by solving the Fisher-KPP equation and fitting a universal partial differential equation (UPDE) as follows:

1. Fisher-KPP-CNN.jl (used for this paper): fits the reaction term with a feed-forward neural network and the diffusion term with a CNN
