# Reorganization Summary

Date: August 2024

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Obsolete Code
- ✅ Deleted `Others/Pluto_nb/` - outdated Pluto notebooks using deprecated packages
- ✅ Deleted `Others/SciML_Notch/` - experimental neural ODE code unrelated to paper
- ✅ Removed unused plots and images from root directory

### 2. Created Clear Directory Structure
```
Notch_EMT/
├── src/                        # Core source code
├── parameter_generation/       # Parameter database generation
├── tests/                      # Verification scripts
├── Data/                       # Simulation data (git-ignored)
│   ├── parameter_databases/    # Generated parameter sets
│   ├── regular/               # Simulation results
│   └── precomputed/           # Pre-computed analysis files
├── figures/                    # Generated figures (git-ignored)
├── models/legacy/             # Old model implementations
├── utils/                     # Utility functions
├── visualization/             # Plotting scripts
├── examples/notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks
└── docs/                      # Documentation
```

### 3. Preserved Essential Components
- ✅ Parameter generation scripts moved to `parameter_generation/`
- ✅ Legacy models archived in `models/legacy/`
- ✅ Visualization scripts moved to `visualization/`
- ✅ Removed redundant `Notch_EMT_tutorial/` (functionality covered by paper code)

### 4. Updated Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with new structure
- ✅ Created SETUP.md installation guide
- ✅ Updated PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

### 5. Verified Functionality
- ✅ Paper script (`src/Notch_EMT_paper.jl`) remains fully functional
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Parameter database accessible at `../Notch_EMT_data/`
- ✅ Pre-computed data files preserved

## Key Improvements

1. **Clarity**: Clear separation between core code, tests, examples, and legacy code
2. **Maintainability**: Related files grouped together logically
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs for setup and structure
4. **Safety**: Created backup tag `pre-reorganization-backup` before changes

## Files Removed
- ~260 files from obsolete directories
- ~1.8M lines of unused code
- Duplicate notebooks and CSV files
- Notch_EMT_tutorial directory (redundant with paper code)

## Important Notes

- The paper script continues to work without any modifications
- Data and figures directories remain git-ignored due to large file sizes
- Parameter database remains external at `../Notch_EMT_data/`
- All essential functionality preserved

## Next Steps

1. Update any external references to old file locations
2. Consider migrating legacy models to modern Catalyst syntax
3. Add more comprehensive tests
4. Document the parameter generation workflow
